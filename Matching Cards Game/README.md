# Matching Cards Game

Unity WebGL demo of game in web browser: https://nhibchung.github.io/project/matchingCards/index.html

## Summary
This project was for me to learn more about using design patterns in Unity. 

For this simple card game, I used the Factory pattern to create a set of cards (in this case, a set of 8 cards with polygon images on them). The idea is to allow for switching out the set of cards with a different set (such as different number of cards, different card images, etc.) easily without changing the code that uses the cards. I also used the Singleton pattern to handle the card matching logic; this pattern can be useful when used correctly.
